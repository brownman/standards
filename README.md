Standards
=========

Standards helps you track the habits you want to make.

I found that when I wanted to build better habits, it helped me if there was a way to track and see how consistent I was being. Standards is designed to be readily accessible, unobtrusive and smart in order to help you do that. [Sign up](http://mystandards.herokuapp.com) and try it out! I'd love to get your feedback.

Standards was influenced by Jake Lodwick's [We Have Standards](http://wehavestandards.com/), Doug Stewart's [DID](http://did.heroku.com/) and [Daytum](http://www.daytum.com).
