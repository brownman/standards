Standards
=========

Standards helps you track the habits you want to make.

I found that when I wanted to build better habits, it helped me if there was a way to track and see how consistent I was being. Standards is designed to be readily accessible, persistent and smart in order to help you easily gauge your progress. Standards was influenced by Jake Lodwick's [We Have Standards](http://wehavestandards.com/), Doug Stewart's [DID](http://did.heroku.com/) and [Daytum](http://www.daytum.com).

Standards is built on top of [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com), [DataMapper](http://www.datamapper.org), [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) and uses a bunch of different gems and services like IronWorker. It's hosted on Heroku [here](standard.herokuapp.com), try it out!
