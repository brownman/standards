<h2>About Standards</h2>
<p class="about">I found that when I wanted to build better habits, it helped me if there was a way to track and see how consistent I was being. Standards is designed to be readily accessible, persistent and smart in order to help you easily gauge your progress. Standards was influenced by Jake Lodwick's <a href="http://wehavestandards.com/">We Have Standards</a> and Doug Stewart's <a href="http://did.heroku.com/">DID</a>.</p>
<p class="about">Standards is built on <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> and <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> and is hosted on <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. The source is available on <a href="http://github.com/interstateone/standards">GitHub</a>.</p>
